		<h2>Weekly Reflection 0</h2>
		<p> I really enjoyed my first week at deep dive coding,
		we learned about general use of PHP storm, how to set up depositories and repositories,
			HTML DOM, Sematic tags, Relationships, SQL data types, UI/UX, and Data design.
		</p>
		<h2> Weekly Reflection I</h2>
		<p>
			Im still enjoying it, its getting more difficult as time goes on but i refuse to give up.
			i enjoy all the people I am around and learning more on PHP, mySQL, and how they connected has been
			the main focus for this week.
		</p>
		<h2>Weekly Reflection II</h2>
		<p>
			It has been a fantastic week, I've been learning a lot more than i expected to, and im adjusting to
			the way the class works and how it flows. Everyone still has a positive attitude, and is never shy to
			help one another. I think everyone is getting closer together and will maintain these relationship even
			after the course is finished.
		</p>
		<h2>Weekly Reflection III</h2>
		<p>
			Hard doesn't even begin to explain how it feels to go through all of this work. Consistent home work and new subjects
			are always keeping me busy, but I still love what I do. I'm so excited and I stay motivated because my classmates
			always give me a reason to be tenacious about continuing the course. So far I love everything I've learned, and I've met
			a lot of cool and important people that I cant wait to start interacting with regularly. We've started meeting people
			in the tech industry and im finally learning how to "get my foot in the door". I'm very excited for what the future holds.
		</p>
		<h3>Forbidden Island Reflection (Week III)</h3>
		<p>
			My team worked very well together, I think us putting our thoughts in and making sure everyone's opinion was
			being considered was our biggest strength. Matt had the ability to transfer treasure cards to anyone, anywhere
			on the map, Luther's ability was being able to remove flood waters from two areas for one action, Zach's ability
			was the ability to move any player two adjacent tiles for one action, and my ability was being able to swim
			over missing tiles. We made sure we used every player to the best of their ability to achieve collecting
			all the treasure and winning the game. Though we were not successful in winning the game, I believe we have the
			team skills to complete the game on our next attempt.
